# Full-Stack Testing (ASP.NET Core 2.2 & Vue.js)
Prototype application with a Vue.js client that has significant unit testing coverage with Vue Test Utils (Jest as the test runner) and configured for e2e testing with Nightwatch. The web API is built using ASP.NET Core 2.2 and unit/integration testing is handled using xUnit.net.

## General/Technology Stack Overview

- Front-end initially scaffolded with the vue-cli with the following options: ```Babel```, ```TypeScript```, ```PWA```, ```Router```, ```Vuex```, ```CSS Pre-processors (node-sass)```, ```Linter (ts-lint)```, ```Unit Testing (Jest/ts-jest)```, ```E2E Testing (Nightwatch)```
- Additionally I added: 
	- [`Bulma CSS Framework`](https://bulma.io/) for modular styling 
	- [`axios`](https://github.com/axios/axios) for REST endpoint requests
	- [`vuex-module-decorators`](https://github.com/championswimmer/vuex-module-decorators) which enables you to write class based vuex store modules
	- [`vue-js-modal`](https://github.com/euvl/vue-js-modal) for displaying compiled templates as modal components, or the option to create modals dynamically at runtime (my preferred modal plugin for Vue.js)
- Back-end Web API using ```ASP.NET Core 2.2``` and a seperate ```xUnit.net``` test project (for integration/unit testing of server-side code). For both Development and xUnit tests I am using the In-Memory database option with ```Entity Framework Core``` for convienence

## Setup
1. Install the following (or confirm installed):
   - [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
   - [Node.js >= v8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. After cloning the repo, run the command ```npm install``` in the ```ClientApp``` directory to restore all Node packages/dependencies from package.json
3. Open the .sln solution in Visual Studio and make sure all dependencies and Nuget dependencies are installed/restored - won't hurt to rebuild the entire solution (both projects)
4. It is setup to run one of two ways:
	- VueCLI
	- Seperately

## Scripts

### `npm install`

After cloning the repo, run this command.  This will:

- Install Node dependencies from package.json

### `npm run serve`

To start the app (development build), run this command.  This will:

- Compile the app and run on the development server

### `npm run lint`

- Run the linter (configured in the tslint.json file found in the root of this project)

### `npm run build`

This script will:
 - Build release Webpack bundles
